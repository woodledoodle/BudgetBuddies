# BudgetBuddies
This app was created to make an easy way to track and save money. The idea is to also implemement a way so that if you add a friend or friends, you and the ones added will get to work on the same budget, write comments and set goals. This could be used in a family or friends trying to plan for a future vacation or big purchase.

This app is still in its developing stages and will be worked on consistently.

Currently django is being used in the backend. To run please uss python manage.py runserver. In the front end, react and react-redux is being used. Please use npm run dev to start
